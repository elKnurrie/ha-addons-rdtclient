# RDT Client (Home Assistant Add-on)

**Version 0.3.1**

This add-on runs the official `rogerfar/rdtclient` container, providing Real-Debrid torrent client functionality within Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Set the **download_path** from the add-on UI (default: `/share/rdt-downloads`).

The add-on will automatically create the download folder if it doesn't exist and make it available to RDT Client.

**Note:** You may need to manually configure the download path within RDT Client's settings after first startup.

### First-run steps

1. Start the add-on and open the Web UI
2. In RDT Client settings, configure your download path to match the path you set in the add-on configuration
3. Keep the default **Database path** `/data/db/rdtclient.db`

## Ports
- **6500/tcp** – Web UI

## Data locations (inside the container)
- `/data/db` – SQLite database (`rdtclient.db`)
- `/share/rdt-downloads` – Default download path (or your configured path)

## Troubleshooting
- If the add-on doesn't appear, click **Add-on Store → ⋮ → Reload**.
- Ensure your configured path lives under `/share` and is writable.
- If you encounter build issues, make sure you're using the latest version of the add-on.
- **Note**: You may need to manually set the download path in RDT Client's settings after first startup.
